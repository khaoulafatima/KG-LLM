# Excel Data Visualization for Research Trends between Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs
This project demonstrates how to read an Excel file using Pandas and create a stacked bar chart using Matplotlib. The script reads data from an Excel file, processes it, and generates a visualization to show the number of appearances for different categories.
This work is done for the research paper: Research Trends for the Interplay between Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs
